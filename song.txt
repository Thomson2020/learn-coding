There once was a girl 
and dreamt so big
she wanted to become a singer
and never knew where to begin

left her town and went to a city
to become a star that she want to be
but never knew that it would be this hard
and her life started to fall apart



so she goes, she goes
To a place she calls home
The home which was left behind
For a dream that she thought could be her home

She goes, she goes to a place she calls home
She cries, she runs to a place where her home is
Cries for her mother and misses her a million
And the warmth of her embrace, and the times that she spent
with her, with her, with her....
